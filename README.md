Code DescriptionThis code implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Here's a breakdown of the code:HTML (<body>):Sets up the structure of the game:A container to hold all game elements.A header with the game title ("Tic-Tac-Toe").A 3x3 grid representing the game board.A message area to display the current game status (e.g., "X wins!" or "It's a draw!").A "Reset Game" button to start a new game.Links the "Press Start 2P" font from Google Fonts, which gives the game a retro, pixelated look.Links to the <script> tag to include the JavaScript logic.CSS (<style>):Styles the game board and its elements:The game board has a visually appealing design with a semi-transparent background, rounded corners, and shadows.Each cell in the grid is styled as a square."X" and "O" are displayed in different colors (red and blue) with animated appearances.The reset button has hover effects, a subtle shine, and a scale animation when clicked.The message text is styled to be bold, with a subtle shadow and a pulsing animation.Winning cells are highlighted with a pulsing green effect.JavaScript (<script>):Implements the game's logic:Variables:boardElement, cells, messageElement, and resetButton: Store references to the corresponding HTML elements for easy manipulation.board: A 1D array of length 9 to keep track of the state of each cell on the board (empty, "X", or "O").currentPlayer: Stores the symbol of the player whose turn it is ("X" or "O").isGameActive: A boolean variable that indicates whether the game is currently active (i.e., not over).winningCombinations: A 2D array that stores all the possible winning combinations of cell indices.Functions:handleCellClick(event):Called when a player clicks on a cell.Gets the clicked cell and its index.Checks if the cell is empty and the game is active. If not, it does nothing.Updates the board array and the cell's text content with the current player's symbol ("X" or "O").Adds a class name  x or o to the cell for styling.Calls checkWinner() to determine if the game has been won or if it's a draw.If the game is over, it displays the appropriate message and sets isGameActive to false.Calls switchPlayer() to switch the current player.checkWinner():Checks all possible winning combinations to see if the current board state matches any of them.If a winning combination is found, it adds the class 'winning-cell' to the winning cells and returns the symbol of the winner ("X" or "O").If all cells are filled and no winning combination is found, it returns "draw".If the game is still in progress, it returns null.switchPlayer():Switches the currentPlayer variable from "X" to "O" or vice versa.displayMessage(message):Updates the messageElement's text content with the provided message.Adds a class name 'winning-message' or 'draw-message' to the message element for styling.resetGame():Resets the board array to its initial empty state.Resets the currentPlayer to "X".Resets isGameActive to true.Clears the text content and removes any added classes from all cells.Clears the message text and removes any added classes from the message element.Event Listeners:Adds a click event listener to each cell, which calls the handleCellClick() function when the cell is clicked.Adds a click event listener to the reset button, which calls the resetGame() function when the button is clicked.In essence, this code creates a dynamic and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a retro aesthetic, smooth animations, and clear visual feedback for the players.
